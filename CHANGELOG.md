<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

#### Balance

 - Covered enchanting perks.
 - Cast Aside (Block) now checks for Stamina instead of Health.
 - Rallying Standard now increases Health Recovery instead of increasing Armor Rating.
 - Improved the Stagger from Timed Blocks, after playtesting I felt as though the stagger from Timed Blocks never triggered and it felt bad.
 - Timed Blocks now increase Blocking power by up to 100% based on Block Skill. (was 50%).
   - Blocking Power starts at 1.5x power, and increases to 2.0x power @ 100 Block Skill.
 - Increased Timed Blocking window from 300ms to 330ms. Hopefully this isn't being too generous, but it should greatly improve the feel of Timed Blocking. Please give me feedback on whether or not this makes the mechanic too easy.

   - Standard Talismans refund 5 Refined Essences, empowered Talismans refund 8 Refined Essences.
 - Completely rebalanced Armor and Armor-tier Scaling.
   - Some items may have been missed, as is the nature of modders (and Bethesda at times) being incapable of using correct keywords to match items, but 99% of items should be appropriately rescaled.
 - Changed Auriel's Shield to Light Armor to compensate for the lack of Light Armor shield artifacts.
 - Fixed buffs that gave % Skill Use to give something actually useful:
   - Path of Might (Oghma Infinium) now gives +50 Health. (was +20% Skill use to Warrior Skills).
   - Path of Magic (Oghma Infinium) now gives +50 Magicka. (was +20% Skill use to Mage Skills).
   - Path of Shadow (Oghma Infinium) now gives +50 Stamina. (was +20% Skill use to Thief Skills).
   - Tall Papa (Deity) now gives +5/10% Movement Speed. (was +5/10% Skill use to all skills).
   - Akatosh (Deity) now gives +5/10% Spell Absorb. (was +5/10% Skill use to all skills).
     - Amulet of Akatosh now gives +5% Spell Absorb. (was +5% Skill use to all skills).
 - Cloaks added by New Legion are no longer enchantable.
 - Legendary Difficulty is now "Lethal" Difficulty.
   - Damage done by player is now 2.5x (was 0.6x)
   - Damage taken by player is now 4.0x (was 3.0x)
   - Sneak Attacks are 50% less effective.
