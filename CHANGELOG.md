# Changelog

- [0.1.1](#011) Release Date: May 30, 2024
- [0.1.0](#001) Release Date: May 29, 2024

## 0.1.1

Key Info

 - Fixed compilation issue that made the modlist require Ghost of the Tribunal CC.
 - Fixed compilation issue which caused Wabbajack to ignore specific list outputs that I had disabled for previous test compiles.
 - Fixed alpha blending issue with blood decals.
 - Rebuilt NPC combat folders to fix t-posing issues when enemies wielded certain weapon types and combos.
 - Disabled Auto-Potion system (Health potions can still be quick accessed with the `F` key).
 - Swapped SmoothCam shoulder Toggle to `M5` since it was conflicting with the Crouch bind (`C`).
 - Fixed Crushing Blow and Shattering Strikes not mentioning the relevant Stance in tooltip.
 - Fixed Mortal Wounds improperly mentioning "One-Handed" in the tooltip when it should have been "Two-Handed".
 - Moved my control map out of overwrite so Wabbajack WOULD ACTUALLY INCLUDE IT CORRECTLY. :3
 - Adjusted z-axis of reference `C2CAC` in Helgen.
 - Added a temporary subsurface scattering "fix" until Bingus and I have time to adjust ENB SSS more.
 - Distributed Magecore and Wild Witch crafting manuals to Radiant Raiments.
 - Changed Restore-type Potions to restore over 4 seconds (instead of instant), this should allow Potions to still feel good when being used while allowing them to still scale with Potion Duration effects.
 - Enabled the Stagger animations that I forgot to include in the previous version.
 - **EXPERIMENTAL** Disabled Cell Buffer. Hopefully this fixes some crashes.
 - **EXPERIMENTAL** Tweaked the stagger system as staggers felt too weak and inconsistent.
