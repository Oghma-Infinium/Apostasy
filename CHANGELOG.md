  - `5, -4` and `6, -4`

- Improvements to the visuals of the list.
- Reworks for several major perk trees.
- Adjusted level scaling of enemies.
- Reworked the balance of the Poise System.
- Dragon Priest tuning.

- Fixed a bunch of issues with first person animations.

<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

#### Balance

- Marksman (Archery), Pugilist (Hand to Hand), Skirmisher (One-Handed), and Champion (Two-Handed) now give a flat damage bonus instead of a stacking damage bonus.
  - These perks ended up being relatively weak compared to other perks and were frankly overcomplicated for "Mastery" perks.
- Changes to most perk trees to improve the flow between perks.
  - Too many changes, I do not feel like listing them all.
  - 1H, 2H, H2H, Archery, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Block, and Speech were the main trees that were affected.
- Power attacks now increase **Critical Chance** rather than **Critical Damage** (it's a multiplicative buff, so if you have 0% crit strike chance, you will still have 0% crit strike chance when power attacking).
- General improvements to most capstone perks, especially the ones I believed were underwhelming.
- Reduced cost of Sprinting with a Horse.
- Added a background perk that increases the chance to recover arrows as you improve your Archery skill.
- Changed the way in which Low Stamina penalties are applied. Penalties for low Stamina now last for 10 seconds or until an actor replenishes 50% of their Stamina.
  - Low Stamina penalties include:
    - 25% less damage done (does not affect magic).
    - 25% slower movement.
    - 50% less Poise damage done.
    - 50% less effective at blocking.
- Reduced the Low Stamina Movement Speed penalty to 10% for the player (was 25%).
- Buffed base strength of Grievous Wounds and Mortal Wounds by ~20-25%.
- Adjusted the Health on Vulom (Wyrmstooth).
- Removed Renewal heal from Vulom (Wyrmstooth).
- Adjusted level scaling of the weakest enemy spawns.
  - This will result in you fighting lower level enemies on average due to the way Skyrim populates dungeons.
- Buffed strength of Yngol and Ahzidal unique armor sets.
- Increased the difficulty of lockpicking because I want people to use Security.
- Dungeon Master (Security) now adds more useful items to chests rather than useless items that net you more gold.
  - This includes 8 possible unique item drops.
- Dragon Priest Balancing. While I would like Dragon Priest to remain a challenge (read: a gear/build check), I feel their current implementation was a little too oppressive and created unfun gameplay loops.
  - Removed 25% Magic Resistance passive from Dragon Priests.
  - Reduced the 25% Resistance to Opportunity Attacks to 20%.
  - Dragon Priests now have a resistance to Illusion spells.
    - A level 50 Dragon Priest will require a level 75 Illusion spell to be affected (currently this can be acheived with a dual cast Adept spell if you are perked into Illusion).
  - Removed the Deep Freeze, Wildfire, Power Surge, and Scourge Perks from Dragon Priests (excluding Miraak).
    - A lot of these perks meant that you would just immediately die the moment you fell under 50% HP, and I felt this wasn't very intuitive and produced bad gameplay.
  - Blizzard now costs 3.0x Magicka for Dragon Priests (affects Morokei, Dukaan, and Krosis).
    - This should hopefully reduce the Blizzard spam that these enemies do.
  - Healing spells are 33% less effective for Dragon Priests.
- Reduced the speed of Hawk Stance Greatsword by ~5-10%. (3rd person)
- Reduced the speed of Wolf Stance Sword + Shield by ~5-10%. (3rd person)
  - Improved chaining of the stance.
- Nerfed the damage Archers deal.
- Reduced the chances of enemies spawning with DaiKatanas, Katanas, and Spears by a slight amount at lower levels.
- Removed one archer NPC from the last room of White River Watch.
- Changed the level scaling of two archer NPCs outside of Bleak Falls Barrow.
- Tweaked degradation rates.
- Reduced the number of Harvestable plants in some cities.
- Reduced some Silver Hand enemy spawns in Dustman's Cairn.
- Removed a shortcut in Dustman's Cairn.
- Slightly increased cost of carriages.
- Reduced enemy spawns at Fort Greymoor.
- Reduced enemy spawns at Silent Moons Camp. (Removed Ambush Spawns)
- Doubled Elemental Fury's base cooldown.
- Frost spells now slow by 10%/25% instead of 25%/50% based on Stamina.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed placement of Natura Vendor in Falkreath.
- Fixed Commentary trigger for Khajiit Will Follow in Falkreath.
- Cleaned up yellow mountain flowers that were clipping in some major cities.
- Fixed Pugilist's (Hand to Hand) tooltip erroneously referring to "weapon damage" instead of "unarmed damage".
- Adjusted landscape in the following cells:
  - `-30,10`
  - `-23,18`
  - `-4,3` and `-4,2`
- Fixed issue with Missives quest that was looking for the wrong type of Salmon.
- Fixed issue where Overdose (Alchemy) was not applying to nearby enemies as intended.
- Fixed issue where taking Mirele Bismath teleporter to Winterhold put you into the side of a building.
- Fixed issue where Wyrmstooth's final boss was being renamed erroneously.
- Fixed issue where Ildari could not be properly killed during the [Old Friends](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Old_Friends) quest.
- Fixed some clipping in Wyrmstooth (thanks Kannon for reporting these).
- Fixed missing carriage stop in Solitude. It is now located near Katla's Farm.
- Fixed missing temper recipes for some Wyrmstooth items.
- Fixed crafting conditions on Fleet Knight Sabre.
- Fixed menu crafting menu sorting for some Magecore items.
- Removed Renewal Perk from Poison Dragon Priests.
- Fixed some issues with Silver Tongue perk.
- Dragons should no longer killmove vs the player (hopefully this has been fixed once and for all).
- Fixed missing timed block sound for shields.
- Fixed typo in Talisman's display names.
- Fixed some issues with Dawnguard side quests not properly initiating. (Thanks to Psylence for testing and fixing this)
- Fixed incorrect priorities for first person animations.
- Fixed some issues with timed block key mapping for dual block keybinds.
- Fixed some leveled lists where Orcish equipment was being distributed at lower levels than intended.
- Removed some floating death bells on the Riverwood walkways.
- Fixed web transparency.
- Fixed an issue where Aela and Farkas would change into the wrong outfit after transforming in Proving Honor.
- Fixed an issue where Aela would change into the wrong outfit after transforming in Rampage (unlisted quest after the Circle initiation).
- Fixed some errors with Riverwood Navmesh (again).
- Fixed Tolfdir's Alembic not being interactable (thanks Kannon for testing this).
- Fixed NULL texture set issue with Solitude Bridge (thanks Psylence for testing this).
- Fixed some clipping near Nightgate Inn.
- Fixed an issue where timed block was reducing damage by less than intended.

#### Misc. Changes

- Improved some pathing in Bleak Falls Barrow.
- Improved 32:9 support for some menus.
- Removed Draugr Bleedout animations due to hitbox issues.
- Improved Sword + Shield Animations for Wolf Stance. (3rd person)
- Improved Greatsword Animations for Wolf Stance. (3rd person)
- Tweaked a few Image Space Modifiers for Shouts. Some shouts should blind you less now.
- Disabled stationary dodge for controller.
- Controllers now use cycle for Stances functionality instead of separate binds.
- Paused Magic Menu.
- Improved transitions from sprint attacks into normal attacks.
- Sinweaver (unique item) moved to Reachcliff Cave (was previously sold at [The Scorched Hammer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Scorched_Hammer)).
- Improved IED config.
- Added Backpacks, Pouches, and Satchels.
- Adjusted some Court Wizard outfits to improve diversity.
- Changed Hrongar's Outfit to be more fitting of a high ranking Noble.
- Improved non-performance LOD quality a little.
- Removed horse near Nightgate Inn.

<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

#### Balance

- Infernal Armor (Heavy Armor) now has diminishing returns >500 Armor Rating. This means the maximum spell damage resistance granted by Infernal Armor is 40% (was 50%).
  - **NEW**: Incoming spell damage is reduced by up to 40% based on Armor Rating while wearing a heavy armor chest piece.
  - **OLD**: Incoming spell damage is reduced by 0.05% per point of Armor Rating while wearing a heavy armor chest piece.
- Spears now do less damage. Their movesets were very fast for both the player and NPCs and they seemed to outclass some other 2H weapons by a decent margin in pure DPS.
- Slightly reduced weight of Dai-Katanas to better differentiate them from Spears and Greatswords.
- Adjusted Ebony Blade to be more in line with Dai-Katanas rather than Greatswords.
- Changed some weapon displays in Jorrvaskr to more appropriate weapon types. Changed the ownerships for these displays.
  - I am finally policing player behavior.

#### Bug Fixes

- Adjusted positioning of a Frost Troll at POIVolcanicTundra04 so he no longer got stuck on the nearby icicles.
  - `D8494`
- Fixed landscape seam outside of Loreius Farm.
  - `9,5` and `9,6`

- Fixed some landscape seams near White River Watch.
  - `9,-3`, `10,-2`, `10,-3`, `11,-2`.
- Repainted a lot of area outside and surrounding Whiterun because there were some minor seams and they bothered me.
- Falion will no longer take a 3 hour nap in the middle of his shift. Fixes a crash that could occur in Falion's House.
- Fixed issue with Varla Stone's icon in menu.

#### Misc. Changes

- Corrected default list difficulty to "Adept". Was accidentally compiled on "Expert" last update.

  - **NEW**: While wearing a Light Armor chest piece, Dodging costs 25% less Stamina.

#### Balance

<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

#### Balance

- Weapon tier rebalance.
  - Broke weapons into 5 tiers (based on Smithing perks) the same way Armor had been done since 1.0.
  - This is a minor shakeup to balance, the main place this will be noticeable is the change to Orcish and Dwarven tiering because Vanilla made Orcish/Dwarven Weapons and Armors reversed in their progression (Orcish Armor was stronger but Weapons were weaker than Dwarven equivalents).
- Tweaked Boss Human Battleaxe and Warhammer animations.
  - Adjusted WeaponSwing and HitFrame annotations to improve hitbox timings.
- Player now deals 20% less Poise damage while dual wielding.
  - This change was made to somewhat compensate for the speed and strength of dual wield playstyles relative to others.
- NPCs now deal 20% less Poison spell damage to the Player.
  - This change was made to compensate for how strong Poison felt vs the player.
  - While the numbers were fine on paper, the DoT nature of poison made it feel incredibly unfun to play against and due to the stacking nature of most DoTs, Poison enemies felt overly oppressive.
- Increased drop rate of Thief Stone boons.
- Decreased value of Thief Stone boons.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed missing charge on Viper's Fang (Nazir's Scimitar).
- Adjusted Feris' combat style so she would actually dual wield (which seems to be intended by the author due to her having two daggers).
- Fixed error in Black Market's (Speech) tooltip that suggested that stolen goods could only be traded with merchants who you had already invested in.
- Fixed issue where Streak (Alteration) was unintentionally scaling with certain Shock-based Destruction perks.
- Adjusted floating clutter around Dawnstar Docks.
- Adjusted floating clutter and lanterns on the Dainty Sload.
- Adjusted Pine Tree in Haarfingar that had an extended base and was clipping.
  - `06352F`
- Fixed a landscape seam near Dragon Bridge / Shrine of Kynareth.
  - `-25 22` `-24 22`
- Hopefully fixed a texture corruption by Wabbajack for some grass.
  - This issue caused grass to appear as though it was floating.
  - This change may have a **very minor** affect on performance in some areas if you were previously VRAM limited.
- Fixed a crash that made Gauldur Amulet quest unfinishable.
- Fixed bad occlusion in Dragonsreach Jarl's Quarters.
- Temporary fix for Rugs being incorrectly sized.

#### Misc. Changes

- Rebuilt **3** BSA(s).
- Removed some unused files that were still sticking around from earlier versions of beta testing and some files that were not important for end-user.
- Cleaned up backend of Apostasy's main "controller" plugin.
- Resolved a permission issue with some UI patches.
- Overhauled the Timed Block Implementation.
- Simplified Ultrawide Support Addons into "21 9 UI Support" and "32 9 UI Support" to reduce the number of mods that needed to be enabled/disabled.
- Added preliminary 32:9 support. Thanks to @kannon555 for testing and doing 90% of the work.

#### Balance

- Changes to Corrupted Catalyst (One-Handed).
  - Now a 2 rank perk unlocked at 60/90 skill. (was a 1 rank perk unlocked at 90 skill).
  - **NEW**: Attacks with a One-Handed weapon deal additional damage / and can proc additional effects based on the damage-dealing spell in your off-hand.
  - **OLD**: Attacks with a One-Handed weapon deal additional damage based on the damage-dealing spell in your off-hand.
  - People really liked the concept of the perk but it was locked behind a high level gate. While giving this 2 ranks slightly throws off the balance established with Dual Wield and One-and-None, I think it's fine cause the perk is cool.
  - Also added an ICD to Catalyst so it couldn't double proc off of double hit power attacks as it felt unbalanced.
- Minor changes to Overwhelming Rage (One-Handed).
  - **NEW**: While dual wielding, consecutive attacks against the same target deal up to 50% more damage.
  - **OLD**: While dual wielding in combat, attacks with One-Handed weapons build up rage, increasing your damage by 5% for 30 seconds, stacking up to 50%.
  - Main change here is that it is now per target rather than a global damage boost.
- Tweaked BlockHit knockback.
- Fed buffs now grant Poise Resistance. (was Experience%)
- Reduced the amount of Poise damage arrows and bolts deal by ~40%.
- Dished out Poise damage resistance to non humanoid enemies because they were too easy to stagger lock a lot of the time.
  - Currently between 20-50% resistance based on enemy type and level, will be likely tweaked in future based on feedback.
- Actually implemented the target cap changes I meant to include updates ago.
  - 1H and Unarmed can strike up to 3 targets.
  - 2H can strike up to 5 targets.

#### Bug Fixes

- Removed some road chunks near Ivarstead added by the Kaidan mod that were previously missed.
- Fixed the second Dicks problem (Male nudity was broken after I had previously fixed Male nudity for NeverNude).
- Fixed Talismans' Crafting Menu category being improperly read.
- Fixed UAP load crash by removing the mod. Will likely add it back when the author updates it.
- Fixed issue where some bandits would improperly spawn with Silver Armor.
- Fixed an oversight where "Fed" buffs where they still gave Experience.
- Removed an erroneous "%" from Oghma Infinium's "Path of. . ." tooltips.
- Actually applied the Poise Resistance that was intended for Novice difficulty.

  - For those who increase their FPS limit or uncap through ENB, you can read more on the [Config page](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/apostasy/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md#changing-fps-limit) about which `.ini` files should be edited.

- Renamed and Reworked First Strike (Archery).
  - Perk renamed to Overdraw.
  - **NEW**: Bows and crossbows have up to a 50/100% chance to critical strike, increasing on consecutive hits.
  - **OLD**: Bows and crossbows are guaranteed to critically strike against targets who have not been shot within the last 15/10 seconds.
  - Why did you make these changes?
    - Previous implementation had an issue with the way Skyrim calculates Orders of Operations.
    - Previous implementation also had a bug due to incorrect `OR` operator.
    - I will reimplement the previous iteration once a perk entry I requested a long time ago is implemented.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where having more than 100 base Magicka or Stamina would cause reverting out of Werewolf Form to make you have absurdly low Magicka.
  - This also came with the removal of Growl's Magicka to Stamina transfer when entering Werewolf form. Sorry this is a bug with the original mod that there was no solution to besides "lightening script load" when this didn't seem to be an issue.
  - I am not confident if this fix will work on an existing save game.
- Unarmed now properly scales with the Hand to Hand skill.
  - This change may not take effect on existing saves due to a way the game handles updating Abilities mid-game.
  - I have added in a failsafe that *should* make it work though.
- Reverted the version of Feris the list uses as recent updates broke her.
- Fixed Monk Attenuation causing brawls to become unintentionally hostile.
- Fixed Stone Toss having an instant cast time.
- Properly covered Left and Right hand variants of novice concentration spells that were missed in the last update.
- Removed some 32-bit animations that may have caused crashing.
  - These animations were used by an UNSLAAD boss, I promise they will not affect 99.9999999% of you in any way.
- Fixed KS SMP Hair Collision.
- Timed Blocking should now work in God Mode.
- Normal Attack Stamina Consumption should no longer apply in God Mode.
- Fixed LOD Transition issue with WRStables Wood Wals. (Thanks biggie for pointing this out to me)
- Actually saved the MoreHUD config so the widget on the bottom right was gone like I said it should have been last update.

#### Misc. Changes

- Rebuilt **1** BSA(s).
- New animations for Hawk and Wolf Stances of Dual Katana.
- New animations for Bear Stance of Single-wield Katana.
  - Current Bear Stance was too similar to one of the Sword movesets and it felt wrong.
- Included missing 21:9 Support for TrueHUD.
- Repositioned the Equipped widget for a 1440p screen, it was originally positioned for a 4K screen. Should work better on 1080p now.
- Adjusted Target FPS of some config files as they were incorrectly set to 71 instead of 61.

</details>

### 1.0.3

Key Info

- Save-Safe.
- Should have noticeably improved baseline performance for most people. Make sure to set your CPU Affinity (instructions [here](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy/blob/main/README.md#skyrim-priority-and-setting-cpu-affinity)).
- Added an MCM option to `Apostasy MCM` to disable skinned animals.
- Time skip when skinning animals is now a survival feature (disabled outside of survival.)
  - Change may not take full effect on existing save game.
- ENB Tweaks.
- Changes to Novice Concentration spells.
- Minor tweak to controller config.

<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

#### Balance

- Novice concentration spells (only the spells, staves are unaffected) should now be replaced with bolt variants. This should make early game feel less miserable to play as a melee character fighting mages and should weaken novice mages as concentration spells are frankly too strong.

#### Bug Fixes

- Implemented a script fix for the Class script. Thank you to @ForsakenJing for providing a detailed explanation on the issue and a fix.
- Relandscaped area outside of Folgunthur to fix a gap in between the Mountains.
  - `13 -22`
- Implemented a ~~temporary~~ fix for **FreeformRiften11b** (A Strong Nord Woman) so Svana wouldn't give you the quest endlessly. (Thanks Jay for fixing this so quickly!)
  - ~~The quest still "fails" on completion, meaning you gain a net +0 Experience, I will try to fix this further in the future if the issue turns out to be with Apostasy and not the mod that adds the quest.~~
- NPCs shouldn't try to dodge your attacks when they can't detect you.
- Removed dicks from Nevernude.
- Hid a debug magic effect that was shown in UI.

#### Misc. Changes

- Replaced Dual Mace and Dual Axe Bear Stance animations. Old animations had bad annotations and I didn't think the animation itself felt good enough to warrant fixing.
- Set `Validate Screenshot Location` in `po3_Tweaks.ini` from `true` to `false`, it seems some people were experiencing CTDs on first load with this setting enabled.
- Disabled CPU Affinity by default as incorrectly configured Affinity provided worse performance than no Affinity, and Wabbajack could only ship with my personal setup. Read the instructions are also present in the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/apostasy/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md#performance-optimizations) or the [ReadMe](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy/blob/main/README.md#skyrim-priority-and-setting-cpu-affinity) to set up CPU Affinity.
- Rebuilt **2** BSA(s).
- Improved Sabre Cat and Bear animations because I was bothered about it.
- Added new widget setup for current equipped.
- Disabled MoreHUD's information widget in the bottom right corner. It was mostly redundant with other widgets.
- Unhid DynDOLOD MCM, it was not intended to be hidden by default.
- Tweaked specularity/glossiness on `fxrapidsrocks01.nif`.
- Increased the interior brightness of certain ENB Weather Configs:
  - `!_SKYRIM_Fog.ini`, `!_SKYRIM_Clear_and_Cloudy_FIXED_WEATHERS.ini`, `!_SKYRIM_StormRain.ini`, `!_SKYRIM_Clear.ini`, `!_SKYRIM_Cloudy.ini`, `!_SKYRIM_OvercastRain.ini`, `!_SKYRIM_Locations.ini`
- Added more location IDs to the ENB `weatherlist.ini`:
  - `D64B0`, `7F00`, `53b6`, `53d1`, `3df4`, `d64d4`, `d64d5`, `d64b1`, `53bd`, `53be`, `53c7`
- Set Crash Log Tools (MO2 plugin) to offline mode.
- Controller tweaks:
  - Edit to OCPA Settings to mirror some changes made for keyboard meant to fix a bug.
  - Tweak to TDM MCM for controllers. Target lock key no longer resets camera when there is no target in range.

</details>

### 1.0.2

Key Info

- Some quick fixes.
- Added instructions to the ReadMe for setting up CPU Affinity. These instructions are also present in the [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/apostasy/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md#performance-optimizations), however they are important enough that they are now mirrored in the main ReadMe.

#### Bug Fixes

- Katana's Bear Stance will now use the intended animation rather than using the same animation as Sword's Bear Stance (typo in folder name).
- Moved Travelling Priest Robes from Tanning Rack to Forge for crafting (most already were moved but some were missed).
- Fixed typo in Monk's Class description.
- Changed Custom Window icon to use Apostasy's Icon instead of Ascensio's (I don't know how I forgot to do this until now).
- Repainted area near Skybound Underhang to fix some minor landscape seams.
  - `5 -15`, `4 -15`, `3 -15`

#### Misc. Changes

- [Mihail Skeletons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34368) now use the same animations as [Awoken Draugr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77569) for more stylistic consistency and enemy diversity.
- Changed the `disableSMPHairWhenWigEquipped` in hdtSMP64's `configs.xml` from `true` to `false` for better compatibility with Skyrim Outfit System. **Warning** this might hurt performance if you have SMP Hair on your character ***and*** equip an SMP wig (I do not know why you would do this however).

#### Balance

- Covered enchanting perks.

  - Blocking Power starts at 1.5x power, and increases to 2.0x power @ 100 Block Skill.

  - Standard Talismans refund 5 Refined Essences, empowered Talismans refund 8 Refined Essences.
