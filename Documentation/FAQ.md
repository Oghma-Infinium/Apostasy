## FAQ

### Q: Do I have to read this?
A: No, but if you ask me any question on this document, I will refer you back to here.

### Q: Can I delete the downloads?
A: You can delete or move the download folder after Wabbajack is finished. However, when redownloading or updating the list Wabbajack will redownload *all* files that it can not find proper matches for, so consider this if you have slow internet, don't have nexus premium, or value your time in general.

### Q: Can I uncap the FPS?
A: The list is capped to 61 FPS by default. While [SSE Display Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705) adjusts timing values based on framerate to prevent physics from spazzing out at high framerates, some mods may use havok code that still rely on a ~60 FPS cap to prevent physics-based issues. If you wish to uncap the FPS, then you can do so in the ENB menu **AND** in the `SSEDisplayTweaks.ini` file in the `[Performance] SSE Display Tweaks - Modified` mod.

### Q: What mod is it that makes favorited items/potions/quest items show on my character?
A: [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001). You can open the menu with `Left Shift+Backspace` to customize what you want to show and what you don't want to show.

### Q: How do I reposition my weapons? / Can I have swords on my back?
A: Open the [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001) GUI with `Left Shift + Backspace` and reposition your equipment.

### Q: How do I remove the Glenmoril Witch Head from showing on my character?
A: Open the [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001) GUI with `Left Shift + Backspace`, under `Display Manager` click View > Custom items, look for `Quest - Left Skull`, scroll down to `Equipment overrides`, expand `Glenmoril Witch Head`, and under `General` tick the box next to `Disabled`.

### Q: How do I remove [Insert Quest Item] from showing on my character?
A: I'm not going to write a QA for *EVERY SINGLE* quest item that is displayed via IED. You can figure it out based on the instructions above.

### Q: I still can not figure out how to use Immersive Equipment Displays!
A: Ask around the [discord](https://discord.gg/4WwqfK5yHg) then. Do not make a support thread for these issues.

### Q: My character is really skinny and the weight sliders only adjust the neck and wrist, how do I change my character's body appearance?
A: Open the OBody menu with `;` (check or change the keybind in the OBody MCM if you do not have a QWERTY keyboard).

### Q: How do I start the main questline?  
A: Go to the Helgen Inn, speak to Matlara, and select the dialogue option `"Give me your best room. (X gold) (Start Intro)"` in order to start the intro sequence.

### Q: How do I get Brynjolf to talk to me? / How do I join the Thieves Guild?
A: Read the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/apostasy/blob/main/GAMEPLAY.md#quests-changes). 

### Q: How do I start Dac0da?
A: Read the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/apostasy/blob/main/GAMEPLAY.md#quests-changes).

### Q: I can't find Altano in the Windpeak Inn. / How do I start VIGILANT?  
A: Read the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/apostasy/blob/main/GAMEPLAY.md#quests-changes).

### Q: How do I start UNSLAAD?
A: Read the [Gameplay Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/apostasy/blob/main/GAMEPLAY.md#quests-changes).

### Q: Why can't I use the Skyforge?
A: In order to use the Skyforge you must ask [Eorlund](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Eorlund_Gray-Mane) for permission. You will be allowed to use the forge if you are a member of the Circle or have completed [Missing in Action](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Missing_In_Action).

### Q: Why does it cost a fee to join the College of Winterhold?
A: Because I needed to introduce something approximating Student Loans to the list somehow.

### Q: How do I set up the quick wheel?
A: There is extensive documentation on the [mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345).

### Q: I can't add a weapon/armor to the wheel.
A: This is usually caused by an alternate start mod that adds random items to your inventory. This only happens to the set of starting items you have. To fix this issue, simply drop the item onto the ground and pick it again.

### Q: Can I still use the vanilla favorites menu? I do not like the wheel.
A: If you're on keyboard press `G` to open up the vanilla favorites menu.

### Q: How do I feed as a vampire?
A: Vampire feeding is impacted by [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122597), and takes advantage of [Dynamic Activation Key](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96273) instead of dealing with several message box popups. Hold `Shift` while on keyboard to get the feeding option.

### Q: Can I add/remove [insert mod] to the list?
A: Yes, but if you have to ask, no. Also adding or removing a mod would void any official support.

### Q: Will you add [insert mod] to the list?
A: Use the `#apostasy-requests` channel on discord if you want to suggest mods.

### Q: Will you add OStim/SexLab to the list?
A: If you want to commission me to do so, then maybe. Otherwise, no.

## Known Issues

### Failed to create download folder!
Solution(s)
 1. Upon opening MO2 you may get a error warning like this: `Failed to create "D:\Downloads" Your user account probably lacks permission`. This is due to Wabbajack not changing the ini file of MO2. To fix this find the file `ModOrganizer.ini` inside the same folder as the MO2 exe is and change the line: `download_directory=D:\Downloads` to `download_directory=Your Prefered Download Folder`. It's best to find the line inside the ini by using `ctrl + F`.

### When leveling up skills, new perk nodes do not get highlighted until exiting and re-entering the perk menu!
Solution(s)
 1. This is a bug with advancing skills while inside of an active menu. I won't fix this, it's a minor visual bug, the perks can still be selected even if you don't exit and re-enter menu.

### Dark Brotherhood abducted me when trying to start the Helgen Intro!
> [!NOTE]  
> This should no longer be an issue as of version 2.1+
Solution(s)
 1. Don't be stupid. Reload a save before starting the intro and make sure that you have been abducted BEFORE trying to start the Helgen Intro. 

### Wicked Game Quest (Val Serano) bugged out because of the Dark Brotherhood trying to abduct me!
Solution(s)
 1. See above.

### Night Eye effects do not work well!
Solution(s)
 1. This is an issue with IMODs and ENB not playing together nicely, unfortunately fixing Night Eye effects would require us to rewrite a large amount of the shader code for parts of the ENB used by the list, and we have decided that it is not worthwhile to do this.

### Carriage Horse in Solitude is partially in the wall!
Solution(s)
 1. This bug isn't worthy of my time and I have already tried to fix it. For some reason that is beyond my current comprehension, he does not move after being moved in the CK. I will not waste more brain power and time trying to figure out the cause of this very very minor issue.

### Not receiving Courier Letter from Dark Brotherhood!
Solution(s)
 1. This appears to happen rarely, but from my testing as long as you sleep in a bed they should still abduct you as intended. Not sure what is causing this as of yet.

### Being randomly attacked or arrested by NPCs!
Solution(s)
 1. open the console, select one of the NPCs, and type `paycrimegold 0 0`

### [Insert Male NPC] looks like he has tits / has a really big chest and arms!
Solution(s)
 1. Change their OBody preset, do not report this as an issue to me, I'm tired of hearing about it.

### Can't attack with Left Hand in First Person (Dual Wield or Unarmed)!
Solution(s)
 1. It works fine if you attack with right-hand first, otherwise right click (left-hand) will be treated as a "Block" input.

### Widgets overlap TrueHUD Attributes Widget!
Solution(s)
 1. Seems to be a rare bug and it's fixed on game restart, not sure of cause.

### Stuck in slow motion!
Solution(s)
 1. Bug with Wheeler, just reopen and close the wheel.

### Can't put an item into Wheeler!
Solution(s)
 1. Drop the item and pick it back up, this is usually an issue with items that are added via a script not properly initializing as a reference. 

### Getting "Failed to start Dialogue Quest" error in the start room!
Solution(s)
 1. Seems to be an issue some users experience with version 4.0+ of [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307). Try to restart your game, if that doesn't fix it then reinstall the list as it's likely there are other issues with your install.
 2. When people provide me a method to reproduce this, I will look into it more, however I have never encountered this issue.

## Known Crashes

### Wheeler.dll Crash!
> [!NOTE]  
> This should no longer be an issue as of version 2.0+
**Cause**: Wheeler typically crashes for one of two reasons: 
1. You slotted player-made potions in Wheeler and ran out of them.  
   **Fix**: Do not put player-made potions in Wheeler.  
2. You no longer have an item in your inventory that Wheeler is trying to reference.  
   **Fix**: Open dMenu (Default: `Home`). Navigate to Wheeler Controls --> Reset All Wheels. **This will reset your current Wheeler configuration**.

### Crashing when talking to Azura/Peryite/Augur of Dunlain/[Insert Talking Head Activator]!
> [!NOTE]  
> This should no longer be an issue as of version 2.0+
**Cause**: Bug with the [Katana follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69622) mod if you are on the quest `Chasing the Current` with the quest stage `Talk to Katana another time`.  
**Fix**: Talk to Katana to progress to the next stage (`Head to the Drunken Huntsman`) in order to fix the crash.

### Crashing after loading a save! / Crashing after dying!
> [!NOTE]  
> This issue seems to be mostly resolved as of version 2.1+
**Cause** Skyrim has a multitude of issues when it comes to loading back game data without restarting the game. There are a few culprits that could be the main driver of these crashes, but I have yet to collect enough information or consistently reproducible crashes to report it to the relevant authors.  
**Fix**: Please post logs in in the [discord](https://discord.gg/4WwqfK5yHg) channel `#apostasy-support` if you suffer from these crashes, but realize that I have very little ability to fix them at this current time.

<Details>
<summary>Experimental Fix for crash on load (after dying, after fast travel, from a carriage ride, or just reloading a save game)</summary>

  1.  Navigate to `[Your Apostasy Install Location]\profiles\Apostasy\SkyrimPrefs.ini`  
  2.  Change `uLargeRefLODGridSize =9`  
  3.  to `uLargeRefLODGridSize =5`  
  4.  save changes (CTRL+S)  

This will reduce quality of some large objects at far away distance. **The difference is very minor you're unlikely to even notice it.** Might improve performance as well.
