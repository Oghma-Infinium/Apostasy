## FAQ

### Q: Do I have to read this?
A: No, but if you ask me any question on this document, I will refer you back to here.

### Q: What mod is it that makes favorited items/potions/quest items show on my character?
A: [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001). You can open the menu with `Left Shift+Backspace` to customize what you want to show and what you don't want to show. You can also use IED to determine weapon positioning (if you want weapons to be sheathed on back for example).

### Q: How do I start the main questline?  
A: Go to the Helgen Inn and use the dialogue option `"I forgot what it says"` in order to start the intro sequence.

### Q: I can't find Altano in the Windpeak Inn. / How do I start VIGILANT?  
A: VIGILANT requires the player be level 25, completion of House of Horrors, and completion of Kindred Judgement (the final quest of Dawnguard DLC). 

### Q: How do I start UNSLAAD?
A: UNSLAAD requires the completion of Dragonslayer.

### Q: What is the Pilgrim skill / How do I access the Pilgrim skill tree?
A: The Pilgrim skill is added by [Pilgrim - Custom Skills Framework Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93913) and acts as the way to progress the religion mechanic in the list. You can access the skill tree by using the **Pray** power while sneaking.

### Q: How do I set up the quick wheel?
A: There is extensive documentation on the mod page [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345).

### Q: I can't add a weapon/armor to the wheel.
A: This is usually caused by an alternate start mod that adds random items to your inventory. This only happens to the set of starting items you have. To fix this issue, simply drop the item onto the ground and pick it again.

### Q: Can I still use the vanilla favorites menu? I do not like the wheel.
A: If you're on keyboard press `G` to open up the vanilla favorites menu.

### Q: Sex?
A: No.

## Known Issues

### Naked when in Vampire Lord form!
Solution(s)
 1. Skyrim Outfit System overrides the Armor that is "worn" in Vampire Lord form, but since only the Non-playable armor worn in Vampire Lord form works with Vampire Lord race, the armor that Outfit System visually equips is invisible. Minor issue that is not fixable unless the author of the mod adds some type of smart toggle if you are detected in a VL/WW transformation.

### Being randomly attacked or arrested by NPCs!
Solution(s)
 1. open the console, select one of the NPCs, and type `paycrimegold 0 0`

### Having issues controlling NPCs in Sirenroot!
Solution(s)
 1. The issue is caused by a bad script interaction between Immersive Camera and Sirenroot. You can disable Immersive Camera (and its script patches) in the left hand pane of MO2 for the duration of Sirenroot.

### Crashing when talking to Azura/Peryite/Augur of Dunlain/[Insert Talking Head Activator]!
Solution(s)
 1. If you are using the Katana follower mod and you have the quest `Chasing the Current` with the quest stage `Talk to Katana another time`, then talk to Katana to progress to the next stage (`Head to the Drunken Huntsman`) in order to fix the crash.

### Body type won't change when trying to apply a new body through OBody.
Solution(s)
 1. This issue should be fixed with versions 4.2.0+ of [OBody NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016), however if you still encounter this issue then you should check the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4868).

### [Insert Male NPC] looks like he has tits / has a really big chest and arms!
Solution(s)
 1. Change their OBody preset, do not report this as an issue to me, I'm tired of hearing about it.
