## Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running. Be sure to check out the [Configuration](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md) page to learn more about the controller support, optional tweaks, addons, MCM options, and more.

## Overview and Basics

This section will cover the absolute basics of the list. I suggest reading, or skimming all of the linked mod pages in this section if you are unfamiliar with the preceding mods.

Before reading this section, I suggest looking over the [load order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/Apostasy) and [keybinds](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Apostasy/blob/main/images/Keybinds.png).

#### Archon - Faiths of Tamriel

Archon is an overhaul of Skyrim's religion system that focuses on enhancing and adding deities native to Skyrim's world. Archon is heavily inspired by [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) and [3Tweaks](https://sites.google.com/view/3bftweaksrequiem/character/divine)' implementation of Religion.  

Deity buffs are granted by praying at a shrine associated with that deity. New shrines are added around Skyrim to find and receive blessings from. Buffs are broken up into three major categories: (1) Blessings - these are the base benefits you get by praying at a shrine; (2) Acolyte - these are scaling bonuses that are unlocked and become stronger by performing activities associated with a given deity; (3) Champion - these are capstone bonuses that are unlocked by completing specific quests or feats of strength, in some cases capstones include additional restrictions.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Alchemy Changes</summary>

By default, [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130)'s Restore potions (e.g., Minor Potion of Healing) last for 10 seconds. Due to the changes to potion drinking in Apostasy, keenly the animation, the duration of these potions has been reduced to 4 seconds, and their magnitude has been appropriately buffed.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Artifact Changes</summary>

Apostasy makes a multitude of changes to Artifacts in the list so that they better suit the balance and mechanics of the list. I'm not going to list them all because that would be too much work, but here are the most notable changes:

 - **Cicero's Gloves**: Fortifies Potion Duration by 50% instead of increasing Attack Speed by 10%.
 - **Gauntlets of the Horny Fist**: Additionally makes unarmed attacks deal additional fire damage.
 - **Severin Family Ring**: Fortifies Poison Use by 20% instead of increasing Attack Speed by 10%.
 - **Silver-Blood Family Ring**: Increases Poison Resist by 50% instead of increasing Attack Speed by 10%.

Technically not artifacts but these are going to be listed here:

 - **Agent of Mara**: Healing spells cost 10% less Magicka.
 - **Sailor's Repose**: While under the effects of alcohol, your Health Regeneration is increased by 50%.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Shout Changes</summary>

Apostasy utilizes [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) to overhaul and add new shouts to the world. However, due to some design differences between Apostasy's combat and vanilla-style combat, certain shouts have been tweaked to be more suitable to the list.

Elemental Fury grants your weapons a chance to deal additional elemental damage (similar to Chaos Damage enchantment).
 - Each word adds an additional element (1 word = Fire, 2 words = Fire + Frost, 3 words = Fire + Frost + Shock).
 - The meditation for Elemental Fury doubles the damage of the elemental damage procs. 
 - This shout's duration can be increased by Fortify Shout Duration effects, the damage is unaffected by Fortify Shout Power effects. 

Battle Fury now restores the attributes for yourself and nearby allies.
 - Each word increases the strength of the restore effect.
   - First Word: Stamina
   - Second Word: Magicka
   - Third Word: Health
 - The meditation increases regen of associated attribute(s).
 - The shout's magnitude can be increased by Fortify Shout Power effects and is unaffected by Fortify Shout Duration effects.

Additionally, the two words of Lightning Breath and one word of Poison Breath have been moved to [Icemoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109541) in order to replace the word walls added by that mod and improve compatibility in the main worldspace. The walls moved were the two word walls added to Solstheim by [Stormcrown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90659) and the Lightning Breath word wall east of [Dunshnikh Yal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dushnikh_Yal).

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Standing Stone Changes</summary>

In an effort to create some more interesting effects that can leverage the unique gameplay components of the list, ~~and because I can never make up my mind regarding certain effects~~, certain Standing Stones are changed compared to the default effect in [Stones of Sacrifice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121629).

Apostasy's Ritual Stone Effect:
> Spells cast via scrolls and staves are 50% stronger and last twice as long, however regular spells are half as strong and last half as long.

Apostasy's Shadow Stone Effect:
> You move 20% faster, and performing a dodge marks nearby enemies for 3 seconds. Melee attacks against marked enemies restore Stamina. However, your blocking and bashing are 50% less effective.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Vampire and Werewolf Changes</summary>

Several changes have been made to [Sacrilege](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42408/) and [Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245) to better integrate them with the balance of the list. Here is an incomplete list of the changes made.

Vampires: 
 - **Blood from a Stone** perk now allows absorb spells to affect all non-living targets.

</Details>

### Combat Foundations

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/118893/118893-1720691484-471070989.png)

The following mods are considered the "foundations" of the combat and gameplay for Apostasy:
 - [Stances NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117986) provides the ability to swap between multiple stances. By default, stances only contribute to what animations are used, but some perks provide benefits to specific stances!
   - Default keybinds: `X` for Wolf Stance, `Ctrl+X` for Hawk Stance, `Shift+X` for Bear Stance.
   - Stances affect first and third person.
 - [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) adds Dodging to the game.
   - Dodges are based on Armor Type. Heavy Armor and Cloth users gets a shorter step dodge with shortened iframes, Light Armor gets a longer roll dodge with longer iframes.
   - The Light Armor skill tree has multiple perks to upgrade your Dodge efficiency.
   - In First person, Dodges are always roll dodges.
 - **Custom Timed Blocking**, if you block just before enemy hit, gain increased block efficiency with a chance to stagger the attacker.
   - The Block skill tree has multiple perks to upgrade Timed Block with additional effects and bonuses.
 - [Maxsu Poise](https://github.com/max-su-2019/MaxsuPoise/blob/master/docs/en/Mechanics%20Manual.md) and [Modern Stagger Lock](https://github.com/max-su-2019/ModernStaggerLock) implement a Poise system, which has been fine tuned for the list. Poise Health can be seen on the Special Bar of TrueHUD (the yellow bar above Health on player and target widgets). The Poise system is discussed in more depth in the [Difficulty and Mechanics](#difficulty-and-mechanics) section.

## Leveling and Progression

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/118893/118893-1720520004-1902455222.png)

Apostasy modifies the vanilla leveling experience in a way to reward the player for engaging in the world in sensible ways. While perks can be obtained through leveling, the perks gained from leveling alone are unlikely to be sufficient for sustaining a full character build in late game. Below is a general breakdown of what to expect with the leveling and progression system in Apostasy.

### Changes to Leveling

Apostasy uses [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) and [Static Skill Leveling Rewritten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89940) to handle leveling and progression.

My custom settings are explained below:
<Details>
<summary>XP Breakpoints</summary>

Apostasy modifies the vanilla XP per level requirements.

`requiredXP = 240 + (playerlevel * 20)`

| Level | Cumulative XP Required |  
|     :---:    |     :---:     |  
| 1  | 260  |  
| 10  | 3,500  | 
| 20 | 9,000  | 
| 30 | 16,500  | 
| 40 | 26,000  | 
| 50 | 37,500  | 
| 100 | 125,000 | 

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Static Skill Leveling Settings</summary>

 - Gain skill points equal to 15 + (1 * playerlevel) for each level up, up to 50 points per level (this cap will be hit at level 40+).
 - You can only store a maximum of 60 skill points per level, therefore **after level 40, you must spend all your skill points at level up or you will waste some points.**
 - You can increase skills up to 25 times per level (permitting you have enough points and the skills are adequately below the current skill cap).

Skill Point Costs are as follows:

| Skill Level | Skill Point Cost |  
|     :---:    |     :---:     |  
| 0-25  | 1  |  
| 26-50  | 2  | 
| 51-75 | 4  | 
| 76-100 | 6  | 

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Experience Skill Caps</summary>

 Experience allows the implementation of level-based skill caps.

 `skillCap = 18 + (playerlevel * 2.75)`

| Level | Skill Cap |  
|     :---:    |     :---:     |  
| 1  | 20  |  
| 5  | 31  | 
| 10 | 45  | 
| 15 | 59  | 
| 20 | 73  | 
| 25 | 86  |
| 30 | 100 | 

</Details>

## Difficulty and Mechanics

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/118893/118893-1720419196-1191687929.png)

Rather than Skyrim's vanilla difficulty system of only scaling up or down damage based on difficulty, Apostasy introduces some additional mechanics based on difficulty. You can read more about these mechanics below.

<Details>
<summary>Difficulty Sliders</summary>

| Difficulty | Damage Done | Damage Taken |
|     :---:    |     :---:     |     :---:     | 
| **Novice**    | 1.50x | 0.5x | 
| **Apprentice** | 1.25x | 0.75x | 
| **Adept** | 1.00x |  1.00x | 
| **Expert** | 1.00x | 1.50x | 
| **Master** | 0.75x | 2.00x | 
| **Legendary** | 0.75x | 2.00x | 

Additionally, on Legendary difficulty your spells cost 10% more Magicka, you receive 25% more Poise damage, and your Sneak Attacks are 50% less effective.

</Details>

### Difficulty-based Mechanics

Apostasy overhauls or adds additional mechanics, reminiscent of modern Action RPGs to further enhance the gameplay. Check out the sections below to learn more!

<Details>
<summary>Attacks of Opportunity</summary>

Apostasy introduces a unique Attacks of Opportunity system to the game. This system is designed for the list and can not be found anywhere else. Attacks of Opportunity scale with difficulty and provide advantages to tactical positioning and timing in combat. So how does it work?

When you attack an enemy who is power attacking, drawing a bow, casting a spell, staggered, knocked down, or paralyzed, you will deal 50% more damage and Poise damage. When you attack an enemy from behind (a backstab), you will deal an additional 50% extra damage on top of any other Attack of Opportunity modifier(s) that may be active.

The player is also susceptible to Attacks of Opportunity, however their lethality scales based on difficulty. 

| Difficulty | Player Damage Taken | NPC Damage Taken | Massive Target Damage Taken
|     :---:    |     :---:     |     :---:    |     :---:     | 
| **Novice**    | +0% | +50% | +25% |
| **Apprentice** | +0% | +50% | +25% |
| **Adept** | +25% | +50% | +25% |
| **Expert** | +50% | +50% | +0% |
| **Master** | +50% | +50% | +0% |
| **Legendary** | +50% | +50% | +0% |

Ward spells protect the user from Attacks of Opportunities (player and any NPC).

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Carry Weight and Encumbrance</summary>

Unlike in the Vanilla game, Carry Weight is no longer increases when you distribute level ups into Stamina. Carry Weight can be increased through alchemy, enchantments and equipment, spells, and some other sources.  

On Novice difficulty, your character's natural Carry Weight is increased by 100, making your base Carry Weight 400.  

On Expert difficulty and higher, the new Carry Weight and Encumbrance mechanics are introduced. These mechanics reduce your character's natural Carry Weight by 100, making your base Carry Weight 200. Additionally, when over-encumbered, you take 4 Stamina damage per second.

These changes to carry weight seek to make Carry Weight a more interesting stat, while still allowing people to easily opt out of the system if they decide they do not like it.

| Difficulty | Base Carry Weight | 
|     :---:    |     :---:     | 
| **Novice**    | 400 | 
| **Apprentice** | 300 | 
| **Adept** | 300 | 
| **Expert** | 200 | 
| **Master** | 200 | 
| **Legendary** | 200 | 

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Harsher Health Regeneration</summary>

On Adept difficulty and higher, the Harsher Health Regeneration mechanic is introduced. This mechanic reduces your character's natural Health Regeneration by 100%. When you fall below 50% Health, your Health Regeneration is increased by 100%, allowing your Health to naturally regenerate without any additional buffs. Below 25% Health, your Health Regeneration is increased by an additional amount based on the difficulty.

Harsher Health Regeneration is done to make Health Regeneration a more valuable stat and more desirable. All effects that grant Health Regeneration (food, shrines, enchantments, alchemy, perks, etc.) will continue to function as intended.

| Difficulty | Base Health Regeneration >50% | Base Health Regeneration <50% | Base Health Regeneration <25% |
|     :---:    |     :---:     |     :---:     |      :---:     | 
| **Novice**    | 100%* | 100%* | 100%* | 
| **Apprentice** | 100%* | 100%* | 100%* |
| **Adept** | 0% | 100% |  200% | 
| **Expert** | 0% | 100% | 200% | 
| **Master** | 0% | 100% | 100% | 
| **Legendary** | 0% | 100% | 100% | 

 **On Novice and Apprentice, this mechanic is disabled.*

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Massive Targets</summary>

Apostasy also introduces a "Massive Target" feature for specific enemy types, such as Giants and Dragons. Massive Targets take reduced damage from Attacks of Opportunity and can not be backstabbed. 

Additionally, Massive Targets have a higher likelihood of inflicting Heavy Staggers.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Poise and Stagger</summary>

On Apprentice and Novice difficulty, the player can not be inflicted with Heavy Stagger, unless facing a Massive Target.

On Novice difficulty, incoming Poise damage is reduced by 20% for the player. This results in the player being much more difficult to stagger.

</Details>

### New and Notable Mechanics

<Details>
<summary>Bloodied</summary>

Apostasy introduces a new mechanic referred to as Bloodied. Bloodied targets take more damage from Power Attacks while they are below half Health. The player is not affected by Bloodied on any difficulty.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Confusion</summary>

Apostasy introduces a new mechanic referred to as Confusion. Confusion affects mages when they receive a melee attack while casting a spell.

The player can be affected by Confusion on **Expert or higher** difficulties.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Item Degradation</summary>

Apostasy utilizes [Simple Degradation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74790), which makes armor and weapons lose their tempering durability over time. Weapons will never degrade below +0 tempering (read: they can never become worse than the base item).  

To help manage item degradation, the player can find or craft hammers and whetstones to temper their gear while away from town.

</Details>

<Details>
<summary>Resistance Scaling</summary>

Apostasy changes the way in which resists are calculated. I am adding this section here solely for the min-maxers and for those who care and/or want something to reference. 

 - Armor has a *soft cap* of 75% Physical Resist @ 500 Armor Rating and a *hard cap* of 90% Physical Resist @ 1000 Armor Rating.  
 - Magic and Elemental Resistances have a *soft cap* of 75% Resistance @ 75% Resistance (enchanting, alchemy, etc), however they have a *hard cap* of 90% Resistance @ 150% Resistance. 
   - This sounds convoluted so here is an example of how it actually works in practice: you equip a pair of boots with 50% Frost Resistance as a non-Nord, you will resist 50% of incoming Frost damage, as a Nord you would resist 80% of incoming Frost damage (50% base resist + 50% resist on armor = 100% Frost Resist, however scaling is reduced >75%).

There are effects that exist outside of raw Armor Rating and raw Resistance values that act as multipliers on top of your base resistances, these will usually be worded as "weapon" and "spell" damage (e.g., "You resist 50% of incoming weapon and spell damage").
 - If you have 500 Armor Rating and 75% Magic Resist with the **Defiance** perk in the Heavy Armor tree, then you would have the equivalent of 87.5% Physical and Magic Resistance while power attacking (the required condition to proc Defiance's bonus).

This section is very technical and not necessary to know to play the game normally, however understanding additive vs multiplicative bonuses can better inform decisions made while playing the list. Keep in mind that it is impossible to become *fully immune* to damage.

</Details>
