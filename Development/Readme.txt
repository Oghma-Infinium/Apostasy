The following scripts are being posted to this repo in order to have some amount of code on here in case of GitHub automatically flagging the repo for some reason.

The three scripts I use here are for some grass lod stuff (Only generating grass lods for tundra region) and then some file management stuff (subsurface maps). 

The dds file in this folder is just a 16x16 black texture map.
